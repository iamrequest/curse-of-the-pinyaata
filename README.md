# Curse of the Pinyaata

Put on a blindfold, and use echolocation to play Hit the Pinyaata with a talking cat pi√±ata! Break as much stuff as you can in 2 minutes!



This was my submission to "[Brackey's Game Jam 2022.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7)", a 7 day game jam.

You can download the game for free [here, on itch.io](https://request.itch.io/curse-of-the-pinyaata),
or you can check out my other projects at [request.moe](https://request.moe).

You're free to do whatever with this code, but if you do use it, it'd be real cool of you to link back to this page or the itch.io page (or both). Thanks!
